STAKEHOLDERS NEEDS:

	- 3-Tier Application:
		- VMs:
			* Database server (Microsoft SQL on Windows). (1 vCPU and 4 GB of RAM)-----  
			* Application server (CentOS Linux). (1 vCPU and 4 GB of RAM)-------------- |-------> Images in Storage Container (name: Images)             
			* Web server (CentOS Linux). (1 vCPU and 4 GB of RAM)---------------------- 
			* 6 VMs (app-prod,db-prod,web-prod) 
				(app-dev, db-dev, web-dev)----> Duplicated                 

			* Additional tests: - cloning, dynamically add 1vCPU and 2GB to db server.
					    - Removal of a VM and perform a full restoration.

		- Two environments:
			* Production (built-in data protection using backup/restore with snapshots and no more than 1 hour of data loss after a failure).
			  (managed using IPAM/DHCP from IP pool, vlan 0, 172.31.0.0/24.  Start: 172.31.0.210 
											 End: 172.31.0.230.
			* Development.
			  (Unmanaged on vlan 101, 172.31.101.0/24)

		- Testing: 
			* NTP (pool.ntp.org) and 8.8.8.8 for DNS.

TASKS: 
	- Configurations:

		* The NTP server to the HCI Cloud Platform. (pool.ntp.org) --|___ Settings, NTP Servers, NTP Sever: pool.ntp.org, +Add
		* The Name Server to the HCI Cloud Platform. (IP 8.8.8.8)  --|___ Settings, Name Servers, Server IP: 8.8.8.8, +Add

		* A managed virtual network using IPAM/DHCP in the HCI Cloud Platform:
			- Settings, Network configuration, Network Name: production-net, VLAN ID: 0, Subnet: 172.31.0.0/24
			- Pool address : 172.31.0.210 - 172.31.0.230

		* An unmanaged virtual network in the HCI Cloud Platform.
			- Settings, Network configuration, Network Name: development-nt, VLAN ID: 101

		* A storage container to the HCI Cloud Platform and upload Windows and Linux (CentOS) virtual disk images to the new container:
			- Home menu -> Storage -> + Storage Container -> Name: Images -> Save	
			- Gear Icon -> Image Configuration -> + Upload Image -> Name: CentOS -> Annotation: Linux -> Storage Container: Images 
				-> Upload a file: CentOS.qcow2 -> Save
			- Gear Icon -> Image Configuration -> + Upload Image -> Name: Windows -> Annotation: Windows -> Storage Container: Images 
				-> Upload a file: Windows.qcow2 -> Save

		* Deploying Windows and Linux virtual machines in the HCI Cloud Platform. (Description of the process for the production VMs, ex: app-prod)
			- Home menu -> VM -> + Create VM -> Name: app-prod -> Description: app production vm -> vCPU(s): 1, Number Of Cores per vCPU: 2
			  Memory: 4 GiB -> + Add New Disk, Type: DISK, Operation: Clone from Image Service, Bus Type: IDE, Image: CentOS, -> Add ->
			  Legacy BIOS: DISK(ide.1) -> Add New NIC: production-net -> Add -> Set Affinity -> Save

		* Creating virtual machine clones and change configurations in the HCI Cloud Platform. (Description o the proccess for development VMs, ex: db-prod)
			- Select db-prod -> clone -> edit name to db-dev, delete NIC and Add New NIC: development-net

		* Creating data protection configurations to automate virtual machine snapshots.
			- Home menu -> Data Protection -> + Protection Domain -> NAME: productionprotect -> Select: app-prod,db-prod,web-prod -> Next ->
			  New Schedule: Select Repeat every 1 hour(s), Select Start Date -> Create Schedule

		* Dynamically add CPU/Memory resources to online VMs
			- In order to chek this feature, 1 vCPU and 2GB memory were added to db-prod and restored to the original state for consistency. After this 
			  change, the vm has 2 vCPU and 6 GB of memory, but it was restored before clonning. 
			 (This operation cannot be done simultaneously.  First add the vCPU and then add 2GB to the memory)

		* Performing virtual machine restorations using the data protection snapshots.
      			- In order to check this feature the web-prod VM was deleted on production (Checking first that there was a snapshot and it was restored with
			a new name)
			- From the Data Protection dashboard, use the snapshot to restore the deleted vm.  Select the option Create new entities.

							    

At the time of testing the demo, all tasks were performed successfully and the adoption of this solution will represent great benefits for your company.  

Please do not hesitate to contact us in case you have any technical questions and remember that our goal is to create solutions that represent value for our customers.

Respectfully,
